An Elixir-based client library for **HBCI 2.2** and **FinTS 3.0**.

In 1995 German banks announced a common online banking standard called *Homebanking Computer Interface* (HBCI). In 2003 they published the next generation and named it *Financial Transaction Services* (FinTS). Today more than 2,000 German banks support HBCI/FinTS.

This client library supports both APIs, HBCI 2.2 and FinTS 3.0. It can be used to read the balance of a bank account, receive an account statement, and make a SEPA payment using PIN/TAN.


# Installation
Include a dependency in your `mix.exs`:
```elixir
deps: [
  {:fintex, "~> 0.0.1"}
]
```

# Usage
First and foremost you need bank-specific connection data of the bank you try to connect to (payment industry jargon: *[FinBanks](https://subsembly.com/de/finbanks.html)*). A full list of connection data can be obtained from the [official DK website](http://www.hbci-zka.de/institute/institut_auswahl.htm). Please keep in mind that these connection details are subject to change.
```elixir
blz = "12345678"            # 8 digits bank code
url = "https://example.org" # URL of the bank server
version = "300"             # API version
bank = FinTex.Model.Bank.new(blz, url, version)
```

## Ping
Some banks support the “anonymous login” feature, so you can send a ping request:
```elixir
FinTex.ping(bank)
```

## Retrieve a list of bank accounts
In order to retrieve account-specific data (such as an account's balance), you need credentials for a real-life bank account (usually login and PIN). Note that repeated failed attempts to log in might cause the bank to block the bank account.
```elixir
login = "username"
pin = "secret"
FinTex.accounts(bank, login, pin)
```

## Retrieve all transactions of a bank account
Request all transactions of one of the bank accounts:
```elixir
FinTex.transactions(bank, login, pin, account) # retrieve a list of transactions
```

## Making a SEPA payment
A bank account contains a list of supported TAN schemes each of which can be used to make a SEPA payment. Pick a sender bank account (see above), add the receiver bank account (IBAN/BIC) and define the details:

```elixir
payment = %FinTex.Model.Payment{
  sender_account: %FinTex.Model.Account{
    iban:  "DE89370400440532013000",
    bic:   "COBADEFFXXX",
    owner: "John Doe"
  },
  receiver_account: %FinTex.Model.Account{
    iban:  "FR1420041010050500013M02606",
    bic:   "ABNAFRPPXXX",
    owner: "Jane Doe"
  },
  amount: Decimal.new("1.00"),
  currency: "EUR",
  purpose: "A new test payment",
  tan_scheme: %FinTex.Model.TANScheme{
    sec_func: "921"
  }
}

FinTex.initiate_payment(bank, login, pin, payment)
```
